          Because it's not who we are. Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.

          And yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with great pride. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy. We also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

          And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents - I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. And until we do, our conscience cannot rest. Today there are 12 million undocumented immigrants in America, most of them working in our communities, attending our churches, and contributing to our country. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations. In all nations - including my own - this change can bring fear.

          And in time, I came to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world and in my own life. Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.

          And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black; in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about...memories that all people might study and cherish - and with which we could start to rebuild." Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.

          Thank you very much everybody.
